.\" ====================

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B dhcp-fwd
starts a DHCP forwarding agents which relays DHCP messages between
subnets with different sublayer broadcast domains.

When called without arguments, it reads its configuration from
.BR @sysconfdir@/dhcp-fwd.conf
and forks itself into background. An alternative configfile
can be given by the
.BR \-c
option; the forking can be prevented with the
.BR \-n
switch. There exists a
.BR \-d
option which is indented for debugging purposes and prevents forking
too. Currently it is just an alias for
.BR \-n .

Although the program must be started as root, it will drop its
privileges and go into a chroot-jail after finishing the
initialization.
.\"
.\" ====================

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-n
Prevents daemon from going into background after initialization. This
option may be useful when using advanced init-concepts like minit
(http://www.fefe.de/minit/).
.TP
.B \-N
Like \fB-n\fR but program sends a SIGSTOP signal to itself when
initialization has been finished.  This is interpreted e.g. by the
upstart init system.
.TP
.B \-d
Turns on debugging mode and prevents forking; currently it is just an
alias for \fB\-n\fR.
.TP
.B \-c \fI config_file
Specifies the configfile to use; the default is
.BR @sysconfdir@/dhcp-fwd.conf .
.TP
.B \-v
Shows version
.TP
.B \-h
Shows help
.\"
.\" ====================
.\"
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
The default location of the configfile is determined at
compilation-time and can be overridden by using the
.BR \-c
option. When an option needs a boolean parameter, the keywords true,
false, 0, 1, yes and no are possible values.

Within the configfile the following options MUST be set:
.\"
.TP
.B user \fIusername|uid
The program
.B setuid()\fR's
to the given user after finishing its initialization. The parameter
must be an alphanumeric username or a numeric uid.
.\"
.TP
.B group \fIgroupname|gid
The program
.B setgid()\fR's
to the given group after finishing its initialization. The parameter
must be an alphanumeric groupname or a numeric gid.
.\"
.TP
.B chroot \fIpath
The program goes into this directory and calls there
.B chroot()
after finishing its initialization.
.TP
.B pidfile \fIfilename
The file where the pid of the daemon will be written into.
.\"
.\" ----
.\"
.PP
Beside the mandatory options above, the following options are
possible:
.TP
.B ulimit \fIresource limit
Sets a maximum \fIlimit\fR for the given \fIresource\fR by calling
\fBsetrlimit()\fR appropriately. Possible values for \fIresource\fR
are
.B stack\fR,
.B data\fR,
.B core\fR,
.B rss\fR,
.B nproc\fR,
.B nofile\fR,
.B memlock\fR,
.B as
and (if supported by your OS)
.B locks\fR.
For the meaning of this values see setrlimit(2).

\fIlimit\fR may be plain unsigned number, a number followed by 'k'
(*1000), 'K' (*1024), 'm' (*1000k), 'M' (*1024K) or '-1' to
remove the limit for this resource.
.TP
.B logfile \fIfilename
Specifies the file where messages will be stored. This file is located
relatively to the directory where dhcp-fwd was started and \fBnot\fR
to the directory given at the \fIchroot\fR option.
.\"
.\" ----
.\"
.TP
.B if \fIifname has_clients has_servers allow_bcast
Declares an interface and sets parameter of the network topology. When
an interfacename is used in one of the other options, it must have
been declared by
.B if
already.

.I ifname
is the name of the interface as being used e.g. by
.B ifconfig
also (e.g. eth0).

.I has_clients \fRand \fIhas_servers
tell if messages from clients or servers can be expected on this interface.
.B BOOTREQUEST\fRs are assumed to be client- and
.B BOOTREPLY\fRs are assumed to be server-messages. Unexpected packages will
be dropped away.

.I allow_bcast
is/was an experimentell features and will be disappear probably. When not
set, the interface will not send packages to IP-broadcast addresses. This
affects messages to clients only; when specifying a bcast-server, this
option will be ignored.
.\"
.TP
.B ports \fIifname client-port server-port
Declares the ports which are used on the specified interface
\fIifname\fR for client resp. server functionality.

dhcp-fwd acts as client only, when the \fIhas_servers\fR flag has been
set and sends from \fIclient-port\fR then. Interface will be listen on
\fIserver-port\fR when the \fIhas_clients\fR and/or \fIhas_servers\fR
flags of the interface have been set.

Omitting this option for an interface or using a value of "0" for the
port arguments uses default values.  These are port 68/udp (bootpc)
for \fIclient-port\fR and port 67/udp (bootps) for \fIserver-port\fR
by default.

.B NOTE:
This option exists to avoid conflicts with already running dhcp
servers, clients or relay agents which do not bind to specific
interfaces.  The DHCP/BOOTP protocol relies on the 67/udp + 68/udp
ports and you have e.g. to configure iptable rules which rewrite your
custom port numbers to the expected ones.

See BUGS below for further restrictions.
.\"
.TP
.B name \fIifname agent-id
specifies the RFC 3046 agent-id for the given interface. When not used
explicitly, the interfacename will be assumed as the agent-id.
.\"
.TP
.B ip \fIifname ip
assigns the
.I ip
to be used in the \fIgiaddr \fRfield. By default to IP of the
interface will be assumed but when having multiple IPs for one
interface this option may be usefully.

.B Attention:
.\"
This IP will not be used in the IP-layer; this means
that the UDP packet sent to the server will contain the IP assigned by
the system. To setup \fBthis\fR address, usual SNAT rulesets in a local
packetfilter are recommended.
.\"
.TP
.B server \fItype info
Defines the DHCP server to be used. The following types are supported:
.RS
.TP
.B server ip \fIaddress\fR [\fIinterface\fR]
\fIaddress\fR is a dotted IP-address and the optional \fIinterface\fR
the name of an interface. Please note that mixing declarations without
an \fIinterface\fR parameter and such ones with this parameter will
fail.
.TP
.B server bcast \fIinterface
the DHCP server with be assumed at interface \fIinterface\fR and
contacted with broadcast messages.
.\"
.RE
.\"
.TP
.B compathack \fItype hack
Sometimes, new versions of dhcp-fwd will contain changes/fixes which
might break existing installations. To restore old behavior,
compatibility hacks can be activated.  These hacks are specified by
the \R hack integer parameter.  See the NEWS file for changes are
their corresponding \R hack value.

.RE
For a sample configuration file see the contrib/dhcp-fwd.conf template
in the source-tarball.

.\" ====================

.SH VARIABLE EXPANSION
It is possible to use \fI$VAR\fR style variable expansion for path,
file and interface names, and for ip addresses.  Value of \fI$VAR\fR
will be taken from the corresponding environment variable which must
be defined. Quoting of leading \`\fI$\fR\' characters is possible by
prepending a single backslash.

.\" ====================

.SH BUGS
The ports set up by the \fIports\fR configuration option are used for
binding sockets only.  The default DHCP port numbers (67 + 68) appear
in the UDP headers of the relayed DHCP responses.
