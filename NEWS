Version 0.4
-----------
	- remove agent-id in BOOTREPLYs instead of padding it; WinNT seems
	  to misinterpret it
	- non-ethernet interfaces on server-side are allowed now; thanks to
	  Michal Pokrywka for reporting this
	- minor enhancements in the initscript
	- controlling-terminal will be now closed after forking; thanks to
	  Michal Pokrywka for reporting the problem and giving the proper
	  solution
	- minor code cleanups
	- it _should_ compile with uClibc now
	- FIX: fixed improper usage of alloca() which caused burning
	  computers and crashing satellites when not enabling inlining
	  (reported by Michal Pokrywka)
	- fixed 'condrestart' command of the initscript

Version 0.3
-----------
	- Minor enhancements in the build-system (generalized sed-subst
	  rule)
	- FIX: closing cfg-files after parsing now
	- closing unneeded fd 0 before forking
	- FIX: remove agent-id accordingly RFC 3046 when relaying
	  BOOTREPLY messages
	- 'make splint' finishes checking without warnings now (requires
	  recent CVS version of splint)
	- minor cross-compilation fixes
	- minor fixes to compile with CVS version of dietlibc
	- added option to set specific 'giaddr'; see man-page for
	  instructions
	- added sample configurations to README
	- resource-limits will be used now (after killing remotely a 10km
	  away located router by memory-overcommiting I felt this a good
	  idea)
	- improved logging
	- compiles with egcs-1.1.2 and glibc-2.1.3 now
	- added whitebox-testsuite for some error-prone functions
	- made resource-limits configurabely
	- splint succeeds now with '-strict' settings
	- minor fixes and extensions in the configfile parser
	- SECFIX: drop supplemental groups also
	- awakened the logfile-functionality to life
	- changed default username from dhcpfwd to dhcp-fwd; using three
	  different names (dhcp-forwarder, dhcp-fwd and dhcpfwd) in one
	  small project is a little bit too confusing...
	
Version 0.2
-----------
	- Small fixes in the build-system (WWW distribution rules,
  	  requirements for automake 1.6
	- Fixed broken '--disable-dietlibc' and enhanced this option
