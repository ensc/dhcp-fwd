	  BOOTREPLY messages
	- 'make splint' finishes checking without warnings now (requires
	  recent CVS version of splint)
	- minor cross-compilation fixes
	- minor fixes to compile with CVS version of dietlibc
	- added option to set specific 'giaddr'; see man-page for
	  instructions

	- resource-limits will be used now (after killing remotely a 10km
	  away located router by memory-overcommiting I felt this a good
	  idea)
	- improved logging
	- compiles with egcs-1.1.2 and glibc-2.1.3 now
	- added whitebox-testsuite for some error-prone functions
	- made resource-limits configurabely

	- minor fixes and extensions in the configfile parser
	- SECFIX: drop supplemental groups also
	- awakened the logfile-functionality to life

	  different names (dhcp-forwarder, dhcp-fwd and dhcpfwd) in one
	  small project is a little bit too confusing...
