Release notes for dhcp-forwarder, version 0.1
---------------------------------------------

This program is used to forward DHCP and BOOTP messages between two
networks with different broadcast domains.


FEATURES:
- runs as non-root in a chroot-environment

- supports DHCP Agent IDs as described in RFC 3046. These IDs can be
  defined freely.

- uses AF_INET sockets to listen for DHCP messages so packetfilters
  like iptables can be used to filter incoming messages

- small memory-footprint; the static-linked executable is <40KiB, the
  runtime memory-usage <70KiB



BUGS:
- no documentation; only contrib/dhcp-fwd.conf contains some information

- bad behavior when serverside-interface has a smaller MTU than the
  MTU on the server itself. An example is

         [Server]-- Ethernet --[Router]-- PPP --[Forwarder]

- on client-side only ethernet supported; same holds on server-side if
  server is a broadcast-address
