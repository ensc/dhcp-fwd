Release notes for dhcp-forwarder, version 0.1.3
===============================================

This program is used to forward DHCP and BOOTP messages between two
networks with different broadcast domains.


FEATURES
========
- runs as non-root in a chroot-environment

- uses AF_INET sockets to listen for DHCP messages. Thus, packetfilters
  like iptables can be used to filter incoming messages

- supports DHCP agent IDs as described in RFC 3046. These IDs can be
  defined freely.

- small memory-footprint:
  | #  ls -l dhcp-fwd; file dhcp-fwd; ps u 24528
  | -rwxrwxr-x    1 ensc     ensc        30584 Jun 12 04:02 dhcp-fwd
  | dhcp-fwd: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, stripped
  | USER       PID %CPU %MEM   VSZ  RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
  | nobody   24528  0.0  0.1    64   64 pts/2    S    04:02   0:00 ./dhcp-fwd


INSTALLATION
============
- build with the usual './configure && make && make install'. When
  not having an actual dietlibc, you will need to call ./configure
  with a '--disable-dietlibc' option. *Not* using this flag results
  in significantly smaller binaries and memory consumption.

  Old dietlibc versions, being shipped with prominent distributions,
  are causing strange warnings while compiling and I am not not sure
  if they are harmful or not. I am running dhcp-fwd with dietlibc-0.17
  successfully.

- install contrib/dhcp-fwd.conf in $(sysconfdir)/ and adapt it to your
  needs; the possible settings are described in this file.

  An alternative cfg-file can be given on the commandline with the
  '-c' option.

- start '$(sbindir)/dhcp-fwd'


If you are a RH 7.3 user, I suggest to build an RPM with

|     rpm -tb dhcp-forwarder-0.1.tar.bz2 --without dietlibc'

and install the resulting binary. The '--without dietlibc' is neccessary
since RH ships on elder dietlibc. After installation, the daemon can be
started with

|     service dhcp-fwd start

and enabled permanently with

|     chkconfig dhcp-fwd on


BUGS
====
- no documentation; only contrib/dhcp-fwd.conf contains some information

- bad behavior when serverside-interface has a smaller MTU than the
  MTU on the server itself. An example is

         [Server]-- Ethernet --[Router]-- PPP --[Forwarder]

  (example is not completely correct since the program assumes an MTU
  of 1500 or greater; but when server is on a special device (IPSec
  VLAN??) a similar situation can occur)

- on client-side only ethernet supported; same holds on server-side if
  server is a broadcast-address

- works with Linux only; the device-binding stuff is not specified
  by SUSv3 and I do not know enough other systems to give a better
  solution

- untested
